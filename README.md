# PHP Array NULL Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP when handling NULL values within array iterations. The `foo` function is designed to count the elements of an array, but it incorrectly returns 0 when encountering a NULL value.  This is unexpected behavior for many use cases.

The solution provided addresses the issue and offers more robust handling of NULL values within the array.
